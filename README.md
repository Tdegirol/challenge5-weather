## Usage

The first portion of this challenge is creating the quiz which is utilizing event listeners to react to the users' selection. Upon clicking a wrong answer, time is deducted, and a right answer brings the next question up. The final score is recorded as the time remaining.

In this case, I was able to get local storage working to record a user's entry, but could not get the score to be defined (even when passing it into my function). Unfortunately being out of time this is the best I can do for now and can hopefully clean this up in the future...
